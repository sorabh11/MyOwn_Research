## Disambiguation Matrix (Multi-Bucket Scenarios)

When input could match multiple buckets, use this decision tree:

### Payment vs MOQ
- **Mentions "cannot afford"** → Check if specific amount issue (Bucket #1) or order size issue (Bucket #14)
- **Mentions "payment pending"** → Bucket #1
- **Mentions "quantity too much"** → Bucket #14

### Slow Moving vs Seasonal
- **Mentions "last month's stock"** → Bucket #2 (Slow Moving)
- **Mentions "will order before Diwali"** → Bucket #6 (Seasonal)

### Slow Moving vs Space
- **Primary focus on "not sold"** → Bucket #2
- **Primary focus on "no room"** → Bucket #9
- **Both mentioned** → Choose Bucket #2, note space in details

### Competitor Margin vs Pricing
- **"Competitor giving better margin"** → Bucket #3
- **"Our product price too high"** → Bucket #4

### Delivery vs Service
- **"Delivery was late"** → Bucket #5
- **"Service after purchase poor"** → Bucket #10

### Service vs Quality
- **"Service centers not available"** → Bucket #10
- **"Product itself defective"** → Bucket #13

---

## Edge Case Handling

### Multi-Issue Inputs
When retailer mentions multiple reasons:
1. Identify primary issue (retailer emphasis or explicit statement like "main problem is...")
2. Log primary bucket
3. Capture secondary issues in Additional Details field
4. Flag as multi-issue rejection

### Vague/Unclear Inputs
When input is too vague ("not interested", "not now"):
1. Confidence score will be low (<0.6)
2. Show top 3 buckets for clarification
3. Include "Other" option
4. Encourage sales rep to ask follow-up question

### Offensive/Inappropriate Inputs
If input contains offensive language:
1. Filter and sanitize
2. Still attempt classification
3. Flag for review

### New/Unrecognized Patterns
When confidence score <0.4 across all buckets:
1. Show "Other" option prominently
2. Require sales rep to enter free-form description
3. Flag for knowledge base review
4. If 10+ similar "Other" cases → Consider new bucket

---

## Knowledge Base Maintenance

### Continuous Improvement Process

1. **Weekly Review:**
   - Analyze "Other" category rejections
   - Identify patterns requiring new samples or buckets

2. **Monthly Audit:**
   - Random sample 100 classifications
   - Verify accuracy vs sales rep confirmation rate
   - Update low-performing bucket samples

3. **Quarterly Refresh:**
   - Add new competitor names, regional variations
   - Update seasonal patterns
   - Incorporate feedback from field sales teams

4. **Version Control:**
   - Track changes to sample inputs
   - A/B test new sample variations
   - Monitor impact on classification accuracy

---

## Performance Metrics

Track these metrics for knowledge base effectiveness:

**Classification Metrics:**
- Top-1 accuracy: >90%
- Top-3 accuracy: >97%
- Average confidence score: >0.75
- Rep confirmation rate: >85%

**Bucket Distribution:**
- Monitor if distribution matches expected frequency
- Alert if bucket usage deviates >20% from baseline

**Language Distribution:**
- Track English vs Hindi vs Hinglish usage
- Optimize samples based on actual usage patterns

**"Other" Category Rate:**
- Target: <5% of all rejections
- Alert if >10% fall into "Other"

---

## Integration Guidelines

### For Vector Database Setup:

```python
# Pseudo-code for knowledge base loading

buckets = load_buckets_from_markdown()

for bucket in buckets:
    bucket_id = bucket.id
    samples = bucket.sample_inputs  # All language variations

    for sample in samples:
        # Create embedding
        embedding = create_embedding(sample.text)

        # Store in vector DB
        vector_db.upsert(
            id=f"{bucket_id}_{sample.id}",
            vector=embedding,
            metadata={
                "bucket_id": bucket_id,
                "bucket_name": bucket.name,
                "category": bucket.category,
                "severity": bucket.severity,
                "language": sample.language,
                "keywords": bucket.keywords
            }
        )
```

### For LLM Classification:

```python
# Pseudo-code for classification with validation

def classify_rejection(user_input):
    # 1. Vector search
    top_matches = vector_db.query(user_input, top_k=5)

    # 2. Keyword matching
    keyword_scores = calculate_keyword_match(user_input, buckets)

    # 3. LLM validation
    llm_result = llm.validate_classification(
        input=user_input,
        candidates=top_matches
    )

    # 4. Final scoring
    final_score = combine_scores(
        vector_similarity=top_matches[0].score,
        keyword_match=keyword_scores[0],
        llm_confidence=llm_result.confidence
    )

    return {
        "bucket_id": top_matches[0].bucket_id,
        "confidence": final_score,
        "alternatives": top_matches[1:3]
    }
```
